- [JavaScript Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Example Sudoku](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-sudoku-puzzle-using-html-css-javascript) I mainly used this resource to get an example of how to make a Sudoku board using Javascript and CSS, the code that solves the Sudoku Puzzle is unique.
